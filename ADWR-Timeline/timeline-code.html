<article class="modal six"><h2>1922 - The Establishment of the Colorado River Compact</h2><p>The Compact among Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada and California divided the Colorado River Basin into an Upper Basin and Lower Basin. This Compact appropriated 7.5 million acre-feet of Colorado River water per year to each basin. It also provides a right to the Lower Basin to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million acre-feet (MAF) per year. Arizona refused until 1944 to ratify the Compact over concerns about the allocation of water among states.</p></article>

<article class="modal seven"><h2>1928 - Congress Passes the Boulder Canyon Project Act</h2><p>The Act approved the construction of the Hoover Dam on the condition that the Colorado River Compact become effective. This Act provided a mechanism for making the Colorado River Compact effective without Arizona’s approval, and authorized the Lower Basin States to enter into a compact apportioning the Lower Basin’s 7.5 MAF among the States of California (4.4. MAF), Arizona (2.8 MAF), and Nevada (0.3 MAF). It also designated the Secretary of the Interior as the contracting authority for Colorado River water stored behind the Hoover Dam.</p></article>

<article class="modal eight"><h2>1935 - Completion of the Hoover Dam and the Creation of Lake Mead</h2><p>Following its completion, the Hoover Dam began serving several important purposes on the Colorado River in the Lower Basin. These purposes include river regulation, improvement of navigation, flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and storage of water for beneficial uses within the Lower Basin States and Mexico. Hoover Dam, located in Nevada and Arizona, created Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the United States.</p></article>

<article class="modal nobox eleven"><h2>1945-1948 - Arizona Legislature Passes first Groundwater Code Legislation</h2><p>In response to warnings by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that the Central Arizona Project approval would not occur without restrictions on groundwater use, the Legislature required the registration of wells throughout the State (1945) and prohibited the drilling of new irrigation wells in ten designated Critical Groundwater Areas (1948).</p></article>

<article class="modal nobox twelve"><h2>1963 - The Supreme Court Upholds the Boulder Canyon Project of 1928</h2><p>The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of Arizona in a lawsuit filed by Arizona against California that disputed the claims to Colorado River waters in the Lower Basin. The decision determined Arizona’s Colorado River annual basic apportionment to be 2.8 million acre-feet, California's to be 4.4 million acre-feet and Nevada's to be 300,000 acre-feet. The decision allowed each state the exclusive use of its respective tributary water, a key reason Arizona did not initially ratify the Colorado River Compact. The decision also secured the water rights for Indian Reservations and other federal lands. Finally, the decision established the Secretary of the Interior as the Water Master of the Colorado River below Lee Ferry and granted the Secretary discretion, with some limitations, to determine how much water each state in the Lower Basin should receive during times of shortage.</p></article>

Johnson signed an Act establishing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The fund, championed by Arizona Congressmen Mo Udall, supports protection of federal land and water and provides incentives to states to develop public recreation areas and parks. Since its passage, the fund has resulted in over 2.3 million acres of protected land and the creation of over 40,000 state projects throughout the nation.</p></article>

Johnson signed the Act authorizing the construction of the Central Arizona Project (CAP). Upon signing, the President proclaimed the day “Carl Hayden Day” at the White House to commemorate the passage. As part of the compromise needed to gain its passage, the Act includes a provision that specifies that diversions for the CAP are given a junior priority. This mean CAP water deliveries would be reduced before any reductions were made to California’s 4.4 MAF allocation when insufficient mainstream Colorado River water is available to satisfy 7.5 MAF of annual consumptive use in the Lower Basin.</p></article>
