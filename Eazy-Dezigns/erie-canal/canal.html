<h2> Unlock the Legend </h2>

<p> Come explore some of the oldest water routes in North America and follow in the wake of
history. </p>
 
<p> The legend of the grand Erie Canal flows as strongly today as it did when it was opened in
1825.  Four waterways -- the Erie, the Champlain, the Oswego, and the Cayuga-Seneca -- travel
through New York's heartland, gliding past lush farmland, famous battlefields, scenic port
towns, and thriving wildlife preserves. </p>
 
<p> The 524-mile New York State Canal System connects with hundreds of miles of lakes and
rivers across the Empire State, linking the Great Lakes with the majestic Hudson River and with
five waterways in Canada. </p>
 
<p> Along this historic corridor, visitors of all ages can enjoy more than 2,500 recreational
facilities and attractions.  Pleasure boaters, motorists, hikers, and bicyclists alike will delight in unlocking the legend of New York's canals.</p><p></p>

<h2> Clinton's Folly </h2>

<p> When Governor DeWitt Clinton first proposed a Canal from the Hudson River to the Great
Lakes, detractors dismissed the project as "Clinton's folly."  The Erie Canal took seven years to
build and was the engineering marvel of its day -- yet it was constructed without the aid of a
single professional engineer.  It cut through 363 miles of wilderness and featured 18 aqueducts
and 83 locks, with a rise of 568 feet from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. </p>
 
<p> Finished in 1825, it spurred the first great westward migration of American settlers, opened
the only trade route west of the Appalachians, and help make New York the preeminent
commercial city in the U.S.  The Erie Canal was enlarged three times to accommodate heavy
traffic, most recently between 1905 and 1918 when the present-day Canal system was
configured.
</p> 
 
<p> Today the canals use or run parallel to the original waterways.  And although the focus has
shifted from commerce to pleasure, much of the equipment that allows thousands of recreational
boaters to "lock through" the system's 57 locks every year dates back to 1918 and is meticulously
maintained, often by second and third generation locktenders. </p><p></p>

<h2> Where It Is, What To Do </h2>

<p> The world has changed since 1825, but along the canals the pace today is just as leisurely,
the hospitality just as neighborly for contemporary travelers (as apt to come by car, bicycle, on
foot, or by boat) as in the days of mule drawn packet boats and "hoggee" mule drivers. </p>
 
<p> Nearly every major city in New York can be found along the trade route established by the
Erie Canal:  it links Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, and Albany with New York City.  So
canal life beckons from the doorstep of every New York metropolitan center. </p>
 
<p> And the Canal system threads through five of the state's vacation regions each with a host of
unique attractions.  Scores of parks, picnic areas, restaurants, inns, museums, and historic sites
are strung like small jewels along the canal's banks with even more to explore inland.  Visit
during summer and enjoy one of many Canal festivals held in dozens of towns.</p>

<p> A trip along the canal is a voyage into history.  This rich heritage comes alive in many
settings.  Experience canal traditions at the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse, the Canal Town
Museum in Canastota, and Erie Canal Village in Rome -- a complete, restored 1840s canal
village.  Ride in a mule-drawn packet boat near Medina, or visit Lockport to see locks from the
1840s Canal. </p>
 
<p> Or explore vestiges of abandoned canal sections, preserved stone locks, and grassy towpaths
once trodden by mule teams and now restored for hikers and bicyclists in canalside parks.  Old
lock 52 is adjacent to the New York State Thruway.</p>
<p></p>
<h2> Low Bridge -- Everybody down! </h2>

<p> To truly appreciate New York's Canals you can't be a landlubber.  From May through
November, it's on a boat that the canals truly come alive. </p>
 
<p> Use your own boat or rent a fully equipped canal boat, and chart your own course.  Marinas
provide a full range of services for transient boaters.  You can tie up and explore quiet, 
19th-century canal towns, bicycle to nearby wineries for a tour, then dine aboard as the sun
gently sets. </p>
 
<p> Tour boats also operate on all the Canal System's waterways.  Cruise for a few hours or a
few days, stopping at quaint inns and waterside restaurants along the way. </p>
 
<p> Vessels up to 300 feet long and 40 feet wide and pleasure craft can meander the length of
the
system -- but bridges limit overhead clearance to 15 1/2 or 20 feet. </p>
 
<p> See life from a different perspective.  A solitary blue heron resting at the Montezuma
National Wildlife Refuge in Seneca Falls.  Flocks of geese rising above the Champlain Canal. 
The Adirondacks boldly outlined against the sky at dusk.  These, and thousands of other
memories, are waiting for you.  What you'll see and remember is up to you. </p>
       
 <p> In order to keep pace with the growing demands of traffic, the Erie Canal was enlarged
between 1836 and 1862.  The &quot;Enlarged Erie&quot; was 70 feet wide and 7 feet deep, and
could handle boats carrying 240 tons.  The number of locks was reduced to 72.  Most of the
remaining traces of the Old Erie Canal are from the Enlarged Erie era. </p> 

<p> In 1903, the State again decided to enlarge the canal by the construction of what was termed
the &quot;Barge Canal&quot;, consisting of the Erie Canal and the three chief branches of the
State system -- the Champlain, the Oswego, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals.  The resulting
canal was completed in 1918, and is 12 to 14 feet deep, 120 to 200 feet wide, and 363 miles
long, from Albany to Buffalo.  57 Locks were built to handle barges
carrying up to 3,000 tons of cargo, with lifts of 6 to 40 feet.  This is the Erie Canal which today
is utilized largely by recreational boats rather than cargo-carrying barges. </p>
