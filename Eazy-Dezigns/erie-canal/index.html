  <p> The Erie Canal is famous in song and story.  Proposed in 1808 and completed in 1825, the
          canal links the waters of Lake Erie in the west to the Hudson River in the east.  An engineering
  marvel when it was built, some called it the Eighth Wonder of the World. </p>
 
<p> In order to open the country west of the Appalachian Mountains to settlers and to offer a
cheap and safe way to carry produce to a market, the construction of a canal was proposed 
as early as 1768.  However, those early proposals would connect the Hudson River with Lake
Ontario near Oswego. It was not until 1808 that the state legislature funded a survey for a 
canal that would connect to Lake Erie.  Finally, on July 4, 1817, Governor Dewitt Clinton
broke ground for the construction of the canal.  In those early days, it was often sarcastically
referred to as &quot;Clinton's Big Ditch&quot;.  When finally completed on October 26, 1825, it
was the engineering marvel of its day.  It included 18 aqueducts to carry the canal over ravines
and rivers, and 83 locks, with a rise of 568 feet from the Hudson River to Lake Erie.  It was 4
feet deep and 40 feet wide, and floated boats carrying 30 tons of freight.  A ten foot wide towpath was built along the bank of the canal for the horses and/or mules which pulled the boats and their driver, often a young boy (sometimes referred to by later writers as a "hoggee"). </p>

 <p> In order to keep pace with the growing demands of traffic, the Erie Canal was enlarged
between 1836 and 1862.  The &quot;Enlarged Erie&quot; was 70 feet wide and 7 feet deep, and
could handle boats carrying 240 tons.  The number of locks was reduced to 72.  Most of the
remaining traces of the Old Erie Canal are from the Enlarged Erie era. </p> 

<p> In 1903, the State again decided to enlarge the canal by the construction of what was termed
the &quot;Barge Canal&quot;, consisting of the Erie Canal and the three chief branches of the
State system -- the Champlain, the Oswego, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals.  The resulting
canal was completed in 1918, and is 12 to 14 feet deep, 120 to 200 feet wide, and 363 miles
long, from Albany to Buffalo.  57 Locks were built to handle barges
carrying up to 3,000 tons of cargo, with lifts of 6 to 40 feet.  This is the Erie Canal which today
is utilized largely by recreational boats rather than cargo-carrying barges. </p>
        
        <h3> About this Site </h3>

<p> This web site is devoted to the history of the Erie Canal in general, but focuses to some
extent on the western portion of the canal from the eastern border of Wayne County to Lockport
(Locks 34 and 35), and particularly on the area around the City of Rochester.  The original canal
went right through downtown Rochester and crossed the Genesee River on a major aqueduct. 
The first enlargement of the canal replaced the original aqueduct, which leaked, with a new,
improved aqueduct which still exists in the guise of the Broad Street Bridge.  The last
enlargement of the canal, the Barge Canal, bypassed Rochester, and now goes through the
Genesee River south of the city.  Other interesting aspects of this section of the canal include the
remains of several early canal structures in the Macedon and Palmyra area, the Lift Bridge in Fairport, which is an
engineering curiosity due to the slope and angle of the bridge, and the locks at Lockport, where the current double 24 1/2 foot high locks are
adjacent to one sequence of the original 5 lock pairs.</p>

<p> The main sections of  this site provide views of the old Erie Canal in three ways:</p> 
  <ul>
     <li>Erie Canal Images -- Old prints, paintings, and 
       postcards </li>
     <li>Traces of the Old Erie Canal -- Recent photographs of the remains of old Erie Canal sites and structures, primarily those from the Enlarged Erie Canal era (post-1862) </li>
     <li>Tour the Old Erie Canal -- A journey from Buffalo in the west to Albany in the east by way of a clickable map of the Erie Canal path, and incorporating material from both the Images and Traces sections with additional material. </li>
     </ul>
<p> A good introduction to the history of the Erie Canal can be found on the 175th Anniversary Exhibit pages, which originally accompanied an exhibit put together by the Mandeville Gallery of Union College in Schenectady to celebrate the 175th anniversary of the opening of the Erie Canal.  More historical information can be found in the materials listed on the Books and Videos page, or by following the Erie Canal Related Links. Historical and recent maps can be found on the Erie Canal Maps page. </p>
