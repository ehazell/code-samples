<h2>A Glorious Past</h2>
<p>Hand crafted more than 15 years ago, a Heritage Bentley ensures that its quality is protected in every single way.</p>
<p>Supported by Bentley's extensive range of genuine parts, each one manufactured to the same specification as the original, to safeguard the ongoing performance and condition of your car.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<blockquote>BENTLEY MOTORS WAS FOUNDED BY W.O. BENTLEY IN 1919 WHEN THE FIRST BENTLEY ENGINE BURST INTO LIFE AT NEW STREET MEWS, LONDON.</blockquote>
<img src="http://carrasquilla.faculty.asu.edu/GIT215/bentley-three-half-litre.jpg" alt="heritage bentley-three-half-litre car with old-timey bar in the background" />
<p>From these modest beginnings, W.O’s company went from strength to strength through the 1920s, with an evolving series of acclaimed motor cars and a parade of racing triumphs to prove their outstanding performance. These laurels were capped with five outright victories at Le Mans between 1924 - 1930 and a sixth in 2003.</p>
<p>If we had mission statements in those days, it could not have been expressed more eloquently than in the words of W.O. himself, “To build a fast car, a good car, the best in its class”.</p>
<p>These words are just as relevant today as they continue to inform our beliefs, actions and ambitions for the future. Located in Crewe, England since 1946 and owned since 1998 by Volkswagen AG, Bentley Motors is dedicated to making responsive and powerful Grand Tourers with the stamina to cross continents at pace, and drive in refined comfort and style.</p>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We are Bentley Motors – the definitive British luxury car company, dedicated to developing and crafting the world’s most desirable high performance cars.</p>

<h2>Bentley Brand</h2>
<blockquote>THERE ARE MANY UNMISTAKABLE CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE A BENTLEY – HANDCRAFTED LUXURY, DISTINCTIVE DESIGN, BREATHTAKING POWER AND PERFORMANCE, A REFINED AND EXHILARATING DRIVING EXPERIENCE. YET IT IS THE COMBINATION OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKES OUR BRAND SO UNIQUE.</blockquote>

<p>The six-time success at Le Mans has made Bentley more than a car - it has come to stand for a way of doing things: with spirit, flair, courage, instinctive intelligence and teamwork.  Endurance racing has always been a way for us to test, strengthen and improve the cars.</p>
<p>The dedication and determination that we bring to building our cars intensifies the unique experience every Bentley driver takes from ultimate relaxation to ultimate exhilaration. The task of a Bentley may be to take customers from A to B. But its how we get them there that demonstrates everything about the marque.
More than any other trait, power is the defining characteristic at the heart of our brand. In a Bentley, it’s that distinctive surge, like a giant hand pushing you towards the horizon. In the way we do business, its total self-confidence – delivered with a very British sense of understatement. The Bentley way is to make things appear as effortless as possible.</p>
<p>A Bentley is unmistakable – all it takes is a glance at the twin headlights, matrix grille or the high waistline to know one. The paradox of the car is that although it is instantly recognisable, it takes time and effort to hand-build each one. That’s the assured Bentley hallmark.</p>
<p>A hand-built car using the finest quality natural materials takes time. Yet, while others may do things ‘meticulously’ or ‘painstakingly’, Bentley has always been about passion. In fact, our entire reputation rests on the experienced skills and passion of our people, handed down through generations. Many of our people say that they work on each Bentley as if it were going to be their car. They want to get it right. It’s no wonder that every machinist who creates a set of upholstery signs the back of it with his or her initials. </p>
